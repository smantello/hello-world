This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

My name is Steven Mantello, and I am a senior at the University of Notre Dame studying Business Analytics. I was born and raised in Staten Island, New York and am half-Indian, half-Italian. Here at Notre Dame, I am a member of the marching band where I play the clarinet.
